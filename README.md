# Testing task

## Common description

The app is built with Create React App. It represents a single modal window with a form inside.
The form has two text input fields: email and password. And one checkbox field.
The form is validated on the client side, under validation only two fields: email and password.
All app is built without any UI starter kits, only with React and TypeScript.
All styles are written in SCSS and CSS with a very basic approach.
In the scope of this test task, I provided samples of Unit tests and Integration tests
via React Testing Library.
